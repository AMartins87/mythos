[Introduction](#introduction)
Mythos is a blog-style website where users can read about local myths and legends from all over the world. They can also add their own local stories. 


## USER STORIES

As a site user and site admin I want to be able to login/logout of my account so I can interact with the site’s posts and users

# External user’s goal:
# *As a site user:*
    - I can click on a post so I can read it in full
    - I want to be able to write comments so I can exchange opinions and ideas with other users and the blog owner (*this attracts more traffic and makes the site social*)
    - I want to be able to like and dislike posts so I can show the users and site admin I have liked/disliked their content 

# Site owner's goal:
# *As a site admin:*
    - I can create/publish new posts so that I can keep the blog updated and relevant to its purpose
    - I can edit/delete posts so I can correct typos or incorrect information which I may have provided
    - I can delete site users’ comments if they are against guidelines

I reverted all migrations I made till this point, using a command ./manage.py migrate blog zero, then I proceeded with python manage.py makemigrations > python manage.py migrate and all was ok then.
